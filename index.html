    <br><br><h1 style="text-align:center">Impact of civilizaton</h1>
    <p style="text-align:center">Classical Greek culture, especially philosophy, had a powerful influence on ancient Rome, which carried a version of it throughout the Mediterranean and much of Europe. For this reason, Classical Greece is generally considered the cradle of Western civilization, the seminal culture from which the modern West derives many of its founding archetypes and ideas in politics, philosophy, science, and art</p>

This had its origins in the dances and songs of sacred rites, and was always associated with religious festivals. The Greeks also pioneered the writing of history as not merely the chronicling of events, but in striving for accuracy, objectivity and meaning in their accounts.</p>

                        <h2>Warfare</h2>
                        <p class="lead">Battles were fought between large formations of foot soldiers, fighting at close quarters: the majority of the casualties in a set-piece battle would obviously occur at the front of the two formations; if one of the sides turned and ran (a not infrequent occurrence) the all were in danger. Cavalry played a comparatively minor role in Greek warfare.A hoplite, or heavy-armed infantry soldier, was armed with a spear, large shield, and helmet. Better-off hoplites would have in addition a bronze breastplate and greaves. These would tend to fight in the front line, the place of most honour.Several city-sates maintained large fleets of galleys because all the city-states were situated on islands.Therefore Naval warfare was very important.</p>
